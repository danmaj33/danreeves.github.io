<!-- an appropriate site name (it cannot be "The Weather Site")
the site purpose
an available domain name for your site (you are not required to purchase this domain)
- Help: How Domain Names Work and Finding the Right Domain Name (Links to an external site.) - hostgater.com
a simple logo that you have created for your weather site project or that you have found under a creative commons license 
or clearly listed as Free with no required link back from a third part site like https://www.iconfinder.com -->

        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>The name I have Chosen for my site is "Fo'Drizzle". A play on hip-hop language coined by rapper Snoop Dog, and using the litteral slang for a light rain "Drizzle". </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>This site is intended to inform readers of the weather at various locations with a hip-hop theme. This would appeal to those who find a normal weather site boring.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Domain Name</h2>
        <p>WWW.fo-drizzle.com- This domain is available from www.domains.google for 12$</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>Site Logo as seen above is a graffiti style spelling of Fo'Drizzle with text below to accomodate confusion. The Logo uses the sites color scheme.</p>
